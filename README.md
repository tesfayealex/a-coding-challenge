# Project Description

This is a technical challange project for backend engineers.
The project focuses on backend application creation for providing an API for Dashboard to get insights. Full description below

# Main Dependencies

- SQlite3 (Make sure you install this)
- Python 3.8
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Pandas

Full list can be found and installed from requirements.txt

## Installation


  For installing dependencies in python 3.8 use

      pip install -r requirements.txt

  If you are using conda environment use

      python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

  For running the backend system use

      cd app
      python api.py

  Populate data by going to

      localhost:8000/api/populate_data

# Usage

  All api are using get methods to allow easy usage on browser for example

    localhost:8000/api/populate_data
    localhost:8000/api/most_listed_skills?limit=5&offset=2
    localhost:8000/api/talent_grade_count?limit=10&offset=3&order_in=ASC

# Backend Coding Challenge

At aspaara a squad of superheroes works on giving superpowers to planning teams.
Through our product dashboard, we give insights into data â€“ a true super-vision
superpower. Join forces with us and build a dashboard of the future!

## Goal

Create a simple backend application that provides an API for a dashboard which
allows a planner to get insights into client and planning information.

You will find the corresponding data that needs to be imported into the database
in `planning.json`, which contains around 10k records.

## Requirements

1. Create proper database tables that can fit the data model.
2. Create a script that imports the data into the database (sqlite).
3. Create REST APIs to get the planning data from the database.
    1. The APIs don't need to be complete, just create what you can in the
       available time.
    2. Please include at least one example on how to do each of the following:
        1. pagination
        2. sorting
        3. filtering / searching
